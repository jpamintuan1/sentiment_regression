thrillers of the early    s   ', 'A standout scene   ', 'This scene is very strong and unpleasant   ', 'Technically  the film is well made with impressive camera work  solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it s coming from a distant hill   ', 'It s still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema   ', 'The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end   ', 'I liked the way Dustin Hoffman s character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son   ', 'This movie is also revealing   ', 'Personally  I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue   ', 'And it was boring   ', 'I am so tired of clichÃ©s that is just lazy writing  and here they come in thick and fast   ', 'PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up   ', 'It s a fresh  subtle  and rather sublime effect   ', 'An Italian reviewer called this  a small  great film   and that s right   ', 'All the actors give a wonderful performance  especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris  who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star   ', 'You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie  and a lot about the movie business itself   ', 'The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the  acting coach  are fascinating   ', 'Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I ve ever heard   ', 'You won t forget this movie   ', 'Why was this film made   ', 'The film has an ultra cheap look to it   ', 'The result is a film that just don t look right   ', 'None of them are engaging or exciting   ', 'The plot is nonsense that doesn t interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it   ', 'The Foreigner is not worth one

perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut s biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR   ', 'This movie is so awesome   ', 'I loved it  it was really scary   ', 'I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there   ', 'If you want a real scare rent this one   ', '       ', 'This is an extraordinary film

discovering guilt or innocence  but rather  is about who presents better in court   ', 'The film is well paced  understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I ve seen   ', 'This mostly

carries the movie well   ', 'Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations   ', 'It is wonderful and inspiring to watch  and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD   ', 'How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me  the acting  the story  the characters  the supposedly special effects

all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life  the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain   ', 'The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen t bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god  seriously  I just didn t care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards   ', 'The only place good for this film is in the garbage   ', 'The worst one of the series   ', 'Editing  The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion   ', 'When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better  such as when Jay Adams  unfortunate life was a subject of talk  the song Old Man by Neil Young was played  which evokes many emotions   ', 'Cinematography  The film was shot in an interesting way   ', 'Of course the footage from the   s was grainy  but that only enhanced the film   ', 'This film offers many delights and surprises   ', 'When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from  Don Giovanni  that perfectly describes their situation in the movie  you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film   ', 'The story unfolds in   th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period

all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic   ', 'Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing  violin playing anatomist Doctor Quinn   ', 'Conclusion   I loved it   ', 'It s a long time since I was so entertained by a movie   ', 'I struggle to find anything bad to say about it   ', 'Mark my words  this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead   or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with            years down the line   ', 'It s pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in       as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time   ', 'The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand  for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser known cast and for the super intelligent script that doesn t insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism   ', 'Plus  with the movie s rather modest budget and fast running time  it does an amazing job   ', 'Juano Hernandez  an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era  is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South   ', 'Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY    ', 'See it with your kids if you have a chance  it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last    years   ', 'See both films if you can   ', 'It was that year  however  that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce s acclaimed novella  The Dead   ', 'Feelings  thoughts   Gabriel s discomfort during the dance   all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer s grasp in Huston s portrayal   ', 'Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist   ', 'It s very slow

Days is one of the worst big budget action movies I ve ever seen   ', 'He surely doesn t know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write

acting is beyond abysmal   ', 'Everything stinks   ', 'Trouble is  the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable  like character  story  theme and

killings   ', 'It s dumb and pointless  and a complete waste of time   ', 'In short  don t bother with this movie   ', 'I won t spoil it  but the ending in pretty amazing   ', 'The best scene in the movie is at the end  but I won t spoil it   ', 'If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director s ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity  then this is it   ', 'The result is a powerhouse achievement  made more timely now perhaps because of our culture s disturbing fascination with celebrity  and it s distorted interpretations of fame   ', 'A film not easily forgotten   ', 'But  Kevin Spacey is an excellent  verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman Â– and totally believable because he is a great actor   ', 'The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years   ', 'The characters are interesting  even if a bit predictable   ', 'Highly recommended for all ages  although the younger set will probably not appreciate some
